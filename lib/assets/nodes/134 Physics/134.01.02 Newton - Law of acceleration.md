# Newton - Law of acceleration

The acceleration of an object as produced by a net force is directly proportional to the magnitude of the net force, in the same direction as the net force, and inversely proportional to the mass of the object.

**Example**: When you push a shopping cart, the harder you push, the faster it accelerates. A heavier cart requires more force to accelerate at the same rate as a lighter one.
