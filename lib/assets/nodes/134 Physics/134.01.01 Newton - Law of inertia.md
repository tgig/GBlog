# Newton - Law of inertia

An object at rest will stay at rest, and an object in motion will stay in motion with the same speed and direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.

**Example**: A soccer ball will not move until a player kicks it. Once it's moving, it will continue to do so until friction or another force stops it.
