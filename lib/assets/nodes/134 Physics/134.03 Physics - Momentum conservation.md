# Law of the conservation of momentum 

The law of conservation of momentum states that the total momentum of a closed system remains constant unless acted upon by external forces. Momentum is the product of an object's mass and velocity. 

It is useful in understanding the transfer of motion from one object to another. 

**Real-life Example**: In a game of pool, when the cue ball is struck, it transfers its momentum to the target ball upon impact. If the cue ball stops, it has transferred all its momentum; if it continues, it retains some. The total momentum before and after the collision remains constant.
