# Principle of the conservation of energy

The principle of the conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed. E.g. Energy exists in various forms and can be transformed from one form to another. 

It is also used to analyze systems where energy is converted from one type to another. 

**Real-life Example**: A roller coaster at the top of a hill has potential energy. As it descends, this potential energy is converted to kinetic energy, increasing its speed. Friction converts some of this energy into heat.
