# Newton - Law of action and reaction

For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

This law is related to many more topics in this notes repo than I’ve linked above - basically everything. It’s ultra important as a first principle. 

**Example**: 
- When you jump off a small boat into the water, you will push the boat in the opposite direction. The force you exert on the boat and the force the boat exerts on you are equal and opposite.
- When you show love and affection for somebody, they reflect those feeling back to you. When you get annoyed and start an argument with somebody, they are annoyed and argumentative in return.
