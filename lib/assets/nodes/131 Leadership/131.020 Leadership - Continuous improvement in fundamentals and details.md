# Continuous improvement in fundamentals and details

The secret to success is not usually genius or luck or life position. It is knowing the fundamentals and being better and more consistent with them than anybody else. 

Woden was the best ever at this. 

_”Coach Wooden taught good habits.”_

_”The drills he ran at UCLA were mostly the same drills I had run back in high school—the very same drills. Coach Wooden just did them more repetitively and with more speed and precision.”_

_”Our standards were very high when it came to the execution of fundamentals. And fundamentals, done well, are the foundation upon which effective leaders build highly productive teams and very competitive organizations.”_ John Wooden
