# A leader is a teacher

 A leader should know the job to be done better than the people they lead. Napoleon learned every job in the army. Wooden was a basketball player. Gandhi invented his style of resistance. Marshall Rosenberg conceived and perfected NVC. 

Once you know the job better than anybody else, and find yourself in a position of leadership, it is your duty to mentor the people youâ€™re in charge of and teach them your ways of doing it.
