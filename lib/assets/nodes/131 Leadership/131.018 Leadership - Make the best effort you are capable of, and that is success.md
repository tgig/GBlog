# Make the best effort you are capable of, and that is success

Although he was the winningest basketball coach of all time, John Wooden's definition of success had nothing to do with winning. He believed that reaching your own personal highest potential in whatever you set yourself to do was success, and the reward unto itself. 

This is a very stoic principle as well: We have control over our mindset and actions, but not our natural capability, timing, other people, luck. Being satisfied that we are acting appropriately is enough because the rest is not up to us.
