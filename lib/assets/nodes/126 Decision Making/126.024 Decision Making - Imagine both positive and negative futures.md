# Imagine both positive and negative futures

When we make plans or decisions by imagining how we can achieve a goal, that's only half of the proper required thinking, because you always need to [invert]([[126.023 Decision Making - Invert, always invert]]) and ponder how to avoid things going wrong as well. Half of getting what you want is simply avoiding what you don't want.

In positive imagination you are telling yourself what to do in order to be successful with your decision.

With negative imagination, you are telling yourself what not to do in order to avoid failure with your decision.
