The 10-10-10 decision-making method was developed by Suzy Welch, a business writer, speaker, and author. The concept is simple but effective. Here's a summary of it:

1. **For each potential "decision", consider the implications in 10 minutes, 10 months, and 10 years**. I.e., the immediate, short-term, and long-term consequences:
	- **10 Minutes**: Think about how you'll feel about the decision in the immediate future. This is often influenced by your emotions, gut feelings, and instincts.
	- **10 Months**: Reflect on the possible impact of your decision in the near future. This time frame allows you to go beyond the emotional reaction and consider the more practical and logistical implications.
	- **10 Years**: Finally, consider the potential long-term effects of the decision. This perspective helps you evaluate the strategic and life-altering implications.

2. **Evaluate the outcomes and make the decision**: Compare and consider all three timeframes, their potential outcomes, and how these outcomes align with your personal values, goals, and lifestyle. This comparison should help you make a balanced decision, considering both the emotional and practical aspects as well as the short and long-term implications.

The 10-10-10 method encourages comprehensive and thoughtful decision-making, rather than impulsive or overly emotional choices. It aims to mitigate the risk of regret, as it takes into account the different impacts your decision could have over time.
