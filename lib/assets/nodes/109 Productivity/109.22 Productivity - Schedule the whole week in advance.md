# Schedule the whole week in advance

To be most effective with big and important projects, schedule the entire week in advance. This practice has a couple of immense benefits:
1. You've gotten clear on what is important to accomplish this week
2. Your calendar is pre-filled so others can't book over it

You can move things around when the inevitable disruption or miscalculation happens. I usually move several things around every day because I will underestimate how long something will happen, or an emergency pops up, etc.
