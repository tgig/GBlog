# Keep it simple for as long as possible

Once you start making something complicated it is very difficult to make it simple again. It will probably _never_ be simple again.

Look at code. Look at spreadsheets. Look at tax structures. Once these things begin to get complicated, they never go back.

Simple isn't always possible, but move beyond simplicity with your eyes open!
