# Escape sequence

When your SSH connection hangs or freezes, it can be frustrating waiting for the session to time out and regain control of your terminal. Here is how to break out of a frozen SSH session more quickly:

1. Hit the Enter key to ensure you're at the start of a new line.
2. Type `~` (tilde). This character is the default escape character for SSH and must be the first character on a new line.
3. Immediately after the tilde, type `.` (dot)
